This plugin extends the WooCommerce e-commerce plugin by setting sequential order numbers for new orders.

== Description ==

This plugin extends the WooCommerce e-commerce plugin by setting sequential order numbers for new orders.  If there are existing orders at the time of installation, the sequential order numbers will start with the highest current order number.

If you like this plugin, but are looking for the ability to set the starting number, or to add a custom prefix/suffix to your order numbers (ie, you'd prefer something like WT101UK, WT102UK, etc) please consider our premium WooCommerce Sequential Order Numbers Pro plugin, available from the [WooThemes Store](http://www.woothemes.com/products/sequential-order-numbers-pro/)

This plugin requires WooCommerce 1.5.6 or greater.
